## Projects

Here I'll be listing various projects I work on or are contributing to.

### Primary

[Steam Screenshots Sorter](https://github.com/Reinachan/Steam-Screenshots-Sorter) - Written entirely by myself in Python. Sorts your Steam screenshots into folders, eventually I'll make it hardlink them and sort the hardlinked versions instead.

[Kitsu Reports to Webhook](https://github.com/Reinachan/Kitsu-Reports-Webhook) - Written from scratch. Fetches latest reports from Kitsu and posts it to a Discord webhook.

[Kitsu Wiki](https://github.com/hummingbird-me/kitsu-wiki) - Designed the UI/UX and styled it. Wrote parts of the logic.

[Kitsu Web](https://github.com/hummingbird-me/kitsu-web) - Fixing bugs, primarily bugs caused by styling. Will work on rewriting this to React with TypeScript.

[AniList High-Contrast Dark-Theme](https://github.com/Reinachan/AniList-High-Contrast-Dark-Theme) - Userstyle for AniList that solves the issue with low contrast making it difficult to read text on AniList. Includes a GitHub action to auto-convert it to a UserCSS, a CSS file, and a bookmarklet.

### Gists

[AniList Emoji Conversion Tool](https://gist.github.com/Reinachan/0e2d1b72cb959581f3fac805d9482dbb) - Simple bookmarklet that converts emoji to unicode codepoints so that it renders correctly.

### Incomplete

[Post backup tool for Kitsu and AniList](https://github.com/Reinachan/anilist-kitsu-posts-to-joplin) - Will fetch your posts on Kitsu and AniList and back it up offline in Joplin. For now, you can use the terribly written [version](https://github.com/Reinachan/AniList-Posts-to-Joplin) that was my first coding project

[AniList Userscripts](https://github.com/Reinachan/Reina-AniList-Userscripts) - Various userscripts for AniList. Currently only implements the emoji conversion tool before posting posts.
